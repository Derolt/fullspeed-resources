# Fullspeed Basics
You have now gone through an introduction, watched a video, know how to approach fullspeed and optimized your game for Fullspeed! It is now time for the fun part, so let's dive into actually learning Fullspeed!

The guide is comprised into 4 main sections. We will start with the absolute basics and guide you through everything you need to know to master the Fullspeed style.

This first section assumes little to no game knowledge about TrackMania, which makes this a perfect start for any new-comers. We will also go over a few details that you may not have picked up even if you are a bit more experience already.
