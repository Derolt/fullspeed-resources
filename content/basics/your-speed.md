Speed is propotional to time. The more speed you have, the less time is needed to move from point A to point B. In Fullspeed, your speed is almost the deterministic factor for how well you are driving and the final result. Because you don't slow down in Fullspeed, you can think of the track as 1 big straight line, and the more speed you have the faster you get to the finish.

Therefore, you should spend most of your time perfecting ways to maintain and obtain speed in Fullspeed tracks. But before we look into ways to do this, let's look a bit on how you can check this speed.

## Speed Checking
No, this is not about creating jumps that only work for certain speeds. This is about looking at your speed at strategical positions throughout the track to determine, first of all; how well you are currently driving the track, but also, it is also a good way to learn and get feedback on what you did.

When experimenting and trying to figure out the best lines, the number one metric for this is your speed. For that reason, you will get a huge advantage by making yourself the habit of always looking at your speed. This is not easy to implement ofcourse. The best way to incorporate this into your driving is simply to always force yourself to do it, even if you think you don't have to. The earlier you begin with checking speeds and get it in as a habit, the more beneficial it will be for you.

## Common places to check speeds
There is no real answer to where the best place to check speeds are as most tracks have unique spots. However, there are some common spots that you can use to get started with speed checking.

In most spots, you check your speed where it stops changing for a split second, as it gives you a much easier reading. Depending on the period the speed freezes for, you may have to practice a bit if the period is very low.

### Jumps
When you drive off a ramp, the speed stops for a bit, this is a very good place to check your speed.

In the example video below, we check our speed when the car leaves the ramp. In this case the speed is 510. You can compare this speed when jump again in a next run and see if you have more or less speed.

### Quarterpipes
When you drive into a quarter pipe, whether it is a turnover, wallride or tube entry, the speed freezes for a split second as you hit the quarter pipe. Features like wallrides, turnovers and tubes typically starts with a quarterpipe. You can see below in the videos how the speed freezes for a small moment when you drive into the quarter pipes. It doesn't matter how you hit the quarter pipes, the speed always freezes for a bit, whether you drive straight on or in an angle.

### Wallrides
In both the entry and exit of wallrides, the speed freezes for a short while where you can check your speed. The entry speed is useful for knowing if you did the section before the wallride well, and the exit speed is good for knowing how well you did the wallride itself.

In this example speed is 479 on the entry and 455 on the exit. You normally check the speed earlier on the entry of wallrides than on the exit as that is when the speed stops and it is possible to see it.

### Turnovers
When entering a turnover, you hit a quarterpipe most of the time, that is a good place to check your speed. However, when you reach the top of the turnover, the speed stops for a split second. The speed you see at the top is more important than the speed you enter the turnover with. This is because it determines your exit speed, which is what you will use for the rest of the track. We will give you more details on how the speed works in turnovers in the later chapters.

### Tubes
Often you check your speed when going up into a tube, as well as at the top of the tube. These are two points where the speed freezes for a split second. When going up in a tube, you wan't to read the highest speed that you got. When you are at the top of the tube, it is the opposite, count the lowest speed you see on your speedometer.

Here in the example video we are entering the tube with a speed of 652, and when we reach the top the speed is at 607 on the lowest.

## Elevation
Since gravity pull you down, you can imagine that when driving upwards you accelerate less, and driving downwards accelerates you faster. This is the same for anything that is not flat ground. When driving through a tube, you can see that as you go up into the tube, you lose acceleration and gain acceleration when driving downwards. 

While we will get more into what a tube is and how to drive it later, you can for now, just try to drive up a hill and down a hill to see for yourself how the speed changes. This can give you a better intuition on how elevation affects your speed.

## Speed Drifting
Speed drifting is a special technique that allows you to accelerate faster than usual. However, speed drifting is a more advanced technique that is used in combination with all the basic techniques of not losing speed. We will look into speed drifting later, but for now, you should not think about it at all. In the next pages, we will guide you through some basic techniques for keeping as much speed as possible.
