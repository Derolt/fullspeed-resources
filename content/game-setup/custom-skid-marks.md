TrackMania allows you to override certain textures in the game by creating some folders that the game actively looks for. With this feature, it is possible to change the look and texture of your skid marks. This is helpful in Fullspeed as we can increase the visiblity of our skid marks.

snixtho discovered the technique to do this for asphalt, and you can read more about how to change your skid marks or even make your own [here](https://snixtho.github.io/tm2020-skids/).
