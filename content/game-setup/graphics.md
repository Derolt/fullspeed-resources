Since Fullspeed is such a high-speed and intensive style to play, having good frame rate will be quite important as it helps with reaction times and seeing what is coming at you in the track.

Under *Settings -> Graphics* you will find all settings related to the graphics of the game.

## Shader Quality
One of the most impactful options on your FPS is the "Shader quality" option. Setting this to low, should boost your FPS by quite a bit. However, there is an important thing to consider in Fullspeed with this option. The lower this option is, the more transparent your skid marks will be. This can be annoying when it comes to speed drifting as you typically need to see the exact overlap. However, there is a solution to this problem below under [Custom Skid Marks](#custom-skid-marks).

## Resolution
There are typically two ways to set the resolution, either to your monitor's settings or 4:3 stretched. This is again up to you and what you prefer. Some Fullspeed players prefer stretched as it makes speed drifting a bit more accurate.

## Motion Blur
Motion blur can make it difficult to see what is happening as edges will be blurred when you are at speed. It is recommended to turn this off while playing Fullspeed.

## Graphics Quality
Most of the graphics quality options does not impact the perfomance that much. If you struggle with FPS, you can turn all of them down. Bloom, lens flare and reflections can in some cases blow up and reduce visibility and it can be a good idea to turn them down for Fullspeed.

## FPS Settings
It is recommended to set your maximum FPS to your monitor's refresh rate. This can limit the amount of resources the game uses and lighten up your cpu for other important tasks. For example while streaming, it can be a good idea to limit the FPS to prevent lag. If you always have more than enough FPS while playing the game, it is also possible to enable the V-Sync option at the bottom. However, this option tends to be laggy if you already struggle with FPS.

## Synchronization
In some cases, you can tune the GPU & CPU synchronization at the bottom to improve your frames. There is no real answer to what is best here, as it depends on your system. Turning it off or enabling it can have both effects. We suggest you play around with it.
